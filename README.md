JavaPOS Contracts 
=================

Hosts the device service interfaces, device control interfaces, data and exception types of the UnifiedPOS reference implementation for Java.

Use this library if your are implementing JavaPOS device services or, if you are implementing an JavaPOS application using your own implementation of JavaPOS device controls instead of the [reference implementation of device controls](https://github.com/JavaPOSWorkingGroup/javapos-controls) provided by this group.
